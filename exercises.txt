SSE02 students: there are a number of obvious exercises that you can
do with source code.

(1) Extend the quickgui framework to support more GUI elements.

(2) Use the quickgui framework to control more of the example
    applications.

(3) Extend the serialization framework to have a more complete support
    of different data types.

(4) Extend the entity-relation framework to support a richer set of
    relation and data types.

(5) Extend the entity-relation framework with automatic serialization
    to e.g. an XML-based format (beware of cycles in the graph).

Note: if you do these exercises by forking the github repository and
working there (requires you to use git for version control), it is
easy for others to see what you have been doing and easy for you to
contribute useful functionality back, should you wish to do so (you'll
get your name in the source code, whee!).
